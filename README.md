# portfolio

My Frontend Web Developer portfolio to showcase my skills and projects.

### Adding Google Recaptcha

Using the automatic method to render the widget was not working, so I then tried explicitly rendering the widget. Adding localhost to Google Recaptcha is still not allowing me to view the widget when in development, which means I need to push commits to check results. Not ideal at all, but my portfolio isn't a high traffic finished product.
