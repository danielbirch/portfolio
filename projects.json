    "descriptionP1": "Before becoming a developer, I was a personal trainer for many years.

There are very few all-in-one platforms available for personal trainers and thatâ€™s where VIPT comes in.",

    "descriptionP1": "When I began learning JavaScript, I thought about creating my own flash cards to help me memorise common array methods, frequently used functions and fundamental principles. Then it occurred to me, why not create an application instead? So I did.",
    "descriptionP2": "I decided to use Vue.js for this project due to its speed, the ability to build using components and simply because Vue is really cool. ðŸ˜Ž The backend is using Firebase for the database, authentication and file storage. As you scroll through the cards, youâ€™re presented with a question. Think about it and answer the question in your head, click on the card to flip it around and view the answer. If you got it right, click on the green check mark box. If you got it wrong, click on the red cross box. Then proceed to the next card. Your answers to each card are stored in the database. ",
